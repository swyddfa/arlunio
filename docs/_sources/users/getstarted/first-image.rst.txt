   A nice sunny day::

      import arlunio.image as image
      import arlunio.shape as shape

      width, height = 1920, 1080
      img = image.new(width, height, color="lightskyblue")

      sun = shape.Circle(xc=-1.2, yc=0.8, r=0.6)
      img += image.fill(sun(width=width, height=height), foreground="yellow")

      hill = shape.Circle(xc=-1, yc=-2.1, r=1.5)
      img += image.fill(hill(width=width, height=height), foreground="limegreen")

      hill = shape.Circle(xc=1, yc=-1.8, r=1.3)
      img += image.fill(hill(width=width, height=height), foreground="lawngreen")


In this tutorial we will be drawing the image you see above. Along the way
you'll learn some of ways you can create simple images and combine them into a
final composition. Given the visual nature of this library it's recommended
that you follow along using a Jupyter Notebook so that you can see the results
of each step incrementally.

We start off by importing the modules we need.

.. code-block:: python

   import arlunio.image as image
   import arlunio.shape as shape

Next we decide on a resolution at which we want to render our final image at
and create an image containing the background color representing the sky.

.. code-block:: python

   width, height = 1920, 1080
   background = image.new(width, height, color="lightskyblue")

Now we'll create a circle to represent the sun and position it over and up to
the left. To produce an image we can use the :code:`fill` function to color in
the circle with a yellow color.

.. code-block:: python

   sun_shape = shape.Circle(xc=-1.2, yc=0.8, r=0.6)
   sun = image.fill(sun_shape(width=width, height=height), foreground="yellow")

Adding our :code:`background` and :code:`sun` images together we can start
building up our final image - order matters!

.. code-block:: python

   final_image = background + sun

Then following a similar process we can create the two hills and add them onto
the final image.

.. code-block:: python

   hill = shape.Circle(xc=-1, yc=-2.1, r=1.5)
   final_image += image.fill(hill(width=width, height=height), foreground="limegreen")

   hill = shape.Circle(xc=1, yc=-1.8, r=1.3)
   final_image += image.fill(hill(width=width, height=height), foreground="lawngreen")

Congratulations! You've just drawn your first image with :code:`arlunio`! Don't
forget to save it as a PNG so you can share it with all your friends ðŸ˜ƒ

.. code-block:: python

   final_image.save("sunny-day.png")

Test Your Skills
----------------

As with anything practice makes perfect so we've included a few exercises for
you to try, can you use what you have learned so far to recreate the examples
below?

We have included a solution for each example if you get stuck but keep in mind
that there is no "correct answer". Quite often there are multiple ways to
achieve the same result!

   Sunset::

      import arlunio.image as image
      import arlunio.shape as shape

      w, h = 1920, 1080
      img = image.new(w, h, color="darkorange")

      sun = shape.Circle(xc=-1.2, yc=0, r=0.6)
      img += image.fill(sun(width=w, height=h), foreground="yellow")

      hill = shape.Circle(xc=-1, yc=-2.1, r=1.5)
      img += image.fill(hill(width=w, height=h), foreground="forestgreen")

      hill = shape.Circle(xc=1, yc=-1.8, r=1.3)
      img += image.fill(hill(width=w, height=h), foreground="green")
