Stylo is a library that attempts to allow users to easily describe the
contents of an image using a blend of Python and Mathematics. It also provides
tools that allow for easy parameterisation of the contents of an image opening
up the possibilities for the creation of animations.

One of the design goals is to minimise the amount of code needed from the user
to achieve the desired result.
