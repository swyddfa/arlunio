**Stylo is in early development, while it is useable we cannot make any
stability guarantees.**

Stylo is a Python library that allows you to create images and animations
powered by your imagination and a little mathematics. While mathematics is very
much at the core you do not have to be a mathematician to use it!


```python
import stylo as st

# Example coming soon!
```

## Installation

Stylo is available for Python 3.6+ and can be installed using Pip:

```sh
$ pip install stylo
```

Be sure to check out the [documentation](https://stylo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
(under construction) for details on how to get started with stylo.
