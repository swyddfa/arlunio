    Repeatedly draw the given defintition in a grid.

    This works by splitting the resolution of the final image into an :code:`n` by
    :code:`m` grid and rendering the given definition instance once and tiling the
    result across the remaining grid squares.

    .. note::

       Due to a limitation in the current implementation of this, you will get the best
       results if your :code:`n` by :code:`m` grid divides cleanly into the resolution
       of the final image.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n:
        The number of times to repeat the shape horizontally across the image
    m:
        The number of times to repeat the shape vertically across the image. If
        :code:`None` this defaults to the value of :code:`n`
    defn:

       Due to how each enlarged pixel in the final image is mapped onto a rectangular
       region of real pixels, unless your :code:`n` by :code:`m` grid matches the aspect
       ratio of the final image you will find your original shape will be distorted as
       it is strectched to cover the final image.

        A 2D boolean numpy array that specifies which pixels to color in.
