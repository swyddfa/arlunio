Introduce the concept of operators. Operators are definitions that can provide
implementations of the arithmetic operators in Python like :code:`+` and
:code:`-`. Depending on the type a definition produces different operators can
be defined that allow them to be combined in some way. The standard library has
been updated to incorporate a few operators for working with masks.
